%To carry out this operations, firstly, we need to define a strategy to
%code this correctly;

r = (20 - 8)^3
h = (((1 - 3)/(5^2 - 1))^2)
c = 2^3

%If I define the variables in this way, I believe I can code this more
%easily;

z = (r * h) + c

clear 
clc

%Then, I continue with the following operation;

r = (20 - 13)^3
h = (((1 - 3)/(5^2 - 1))^2)
c = 2^3

%I use the operation stated and I solve it;

z = (r * h) + c
