%Script written by Raul Galdeano Pazos.

%First of all, I set the values of the variables set in the homework's
%statement, r and h;

r = 1/2;
h = 2;

%Then, I formulate the expression I will use to calculate the volume of a
%cone;

V = 1/3 * pi * r^2 * h

%Finally, I run the code and I check if there is any mistake on my script
%with the function analyze.
