%In this case, we know that for calculate a perimeter we need to sum all
%sides of a figure.

%If I state that the lenght of a square is L = 4;

L = 4

% Then I can calculate the perimeter in two ways;

%Option 1

perimeterI = L * 4

%Option 2

perimeterII = L + L + L + L

%Finally, I run the code.
